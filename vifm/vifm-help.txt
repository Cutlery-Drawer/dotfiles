       Vifm  is  a ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings. If you
       use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files  with‐
       out having to learn a new set of commands.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it
       is given a different directory on the command line.

       <<llwwiinnppaatthh>>
              Starts Vifm in the specified path.

       <<llwwiinnppaatthh>> <<rrwwiinnppaatthh>>
              Starts Vifm in the specified paths.

       Paths to files are also allowed in case you want  vifm  to  start  with
       some archive opened.  If you want to select file, prepend its path with
       ‐‐select.

       ‐‐ff     only used from the vifm.vim  script.   The  selected  files  are
              written to $VIFM/vimfiles and vifm exits.

       ‐‐‐‐llooggggiinngg
              Log  some  errors  to $VIFM/log.  Also /var/log/vifm‐startup‐log
              (on *nix) and startup‐log in the  directory  of  executable  (on
              Windows)  is  used  to  log  startup process (when configuration
              directory isn’t determined).

       ‐‐‐‐rreemmoottee
              Passes all arguments that left in command line  to  active  vifm

       vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list  of  yanked
       or deleted files.

       Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by
       a register name.  Count is specified after register name.   By  default
       commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

       Though  all  commands  accept  registers, most of commands ignores them
       (for example H or Ctrl‐U).  Other commands can fill register or  append
       new files to it.

       Presently vifm supports ", _, a‐z and A‐Z characters as register names.

       As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
       default  register.  Every time when you use named registers (a‐z and A‐
       Z) unnamed register is updated to contain same list  of  files  as  the
       last used register.

       _  is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list is
       always empty.

       Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.  Low‐
       ercase  registers  are cleared before adding new files, while uppercase
       aren’t and should be used to append new files to the existing file list
       of appropriate lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

       Registers  can be changed on :empty command if they contain files under
       Trash directory.

       Registers do not contain one file more than once.

       Example:
         "a2yy
       will put names of two files to register a (and to  the  unnamed  regis‐
       ter).
         "Ad
       will  remove  one  file  and  append its name to register a (and to the
       unnamed register).
         p or "ap or "Ap
       will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.

       y,  d and D commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with every
       of
              selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.
              Most  of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %,
              f, F, ;, comma and ’.  But there are some additional ones.

              will associate given program  list  to  each  of  the  patterns.
              Associated  program (command) is used by handlers of l and Enter
              keys (and also in the :file menu).  *, ?, [ and ] are treated as
              special  symbols  in the pattern.  Inside square brackets ^ or !
              can be used for symbol class negotiation and the ‐ symbol to set
              a  range.   Asterisk at the pattern beginning don’t match dot in
              the first position.  If you need to insert  comma  into  command
              just  double  it  (",,").  Space followed by an ampersand as two
              last characters of a command means running of the command in the
              background.   Optional  description can be given to each command
              to ease understanding of what command will do in the :file menu.

              toggles whether or not to use the screen program.
              The default configuration has the screen option turned off.  The
              screen program uses pseudo terminals to allow  multiple  windows
              to  be  used in the console or in a single xterm.  Starting vifm
              from screen with the screen option turned on will cause vifm  to
              open  a  new  screen  window for each new file edited or program
              launched from vifm.
              This requires screen version 3.9.9 or newer for  the  screen  ‐X
              argument.

       ::ssccrreeeenn??

               ‐ for boolean options ‐ nooption, invoption and option!
               ‐ for integer options ‐ option=x, option+=x and option‐=x
               ‐ for string options ‐ option=x
               ‐ for string list options ‐ option=x, option+=x and option‐=x
               ‐ for enumeration options ‐ option=x, option+=x and option‐=x
               ‐ for enumeration options ‐ option=x
               ‐ for set options ‐ option=x, option+=x and option‐=x the mean‐
              ing:
               ‐ option ‐ turn option on (for boolean) or print its value (for
              all others)
               ‐ nooption ‐ turn option off
               ‐ invoption ‐ invert option state
               ‐ option! ‐ invert option state
               ‐ option? ‐ print option value
               ‐ option& ‐ reset option to its default value
               ‐ option=x or option:x ‐ set option to x
               ‐ option+=x ‐ add x to option

       The ranges implemented include:
         Numbers :2,3
         % ‐ the entire directory.
         . ‐ the current position in the filelist.
         $ ‐ the end of the filelist.
         ’t ‐ the mark position t.

         :%delete would delete all files in the directory.
         :2,4delete  would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
         :.,$delete would delete the files from the current  position  to  the
       end
           of the filelist.
         :3delete4 would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

       If a backward range is given :4,2delete ‐ an query message is given and
       user can chose what to do next.

       The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

       %%mm     Show command output in a menu.

       %%MM     Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and
              :find commands.

       %%SS     Show command output in the status bar.

       %%ss     Execute command in screen split.

       %%ii     Completely ignore command output.

       Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

       You  can  use  filename  modifiers  after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D
       macros.  Supported modifiers are:

       ‐ :p           ‐ full path

       ‐ :u             ‐   UNC   name   of   path   (e.g.    "\\server"    in
         "\\server\share"),  Windows  only.   Expands to current computer name
         for not UNC paths.

       ‐ :~           ‐ relative to the home directory

       ‐ :.           ‐ relative to current directory

       ‐ :h           ‐ head of the filename

       ‐ :t           ‐ tail of the filename

       ‐ :r           ‐ root of the filename (without last extension)

       ‐ :e           ‐ extension of the filename (last one)

       ‐ :s?pat?sub?  ‐ substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.   You
         can use any character for ’?’, but it must not occur in pat or sub.

       ‐ :gs?pat?sub?  ‐  like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with
         sub.

         See ’:h filename‐modifiers’ in Vim’s documentation for  the  detailed
         description.

         Using  %x  means  expand  corresponding macro escaping all characters
         that have special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes  and
         escape only backslash and double quote characters, which is more use‐
         ful on Windows systems.

         Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in
         the  command  is  unimportant.  All their occurrences will be removed
         from the resulting command.

         %c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F  are
         expanded to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.

       ::ccoomm mmoovvee mmvv %%ff %%DD
         would  set the :move command to move all of the files selected in the
         current directory to the other directory.

       The %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into  the
       command.  All arguments are considered optional.  ":com lsl !!ls ‐l %a"
       will set the lsl command to execute ls ‐l with or without an  argument.

       ::llssll<<RReettuurrnn>>
         will list the directory contents of the current directory.

       ::llssll ffiilleennaammee<<RReettuurrnn>>
         will list only the given filename.

       The macros can also be used in directly executing  commands.  ":!mv  %f
       %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other direc‐
       tory.

       Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the
       background.Typically  you want to run two kinds of external commands in
       thebackground:
          ‐ GUI applications that doesn’t fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);
          ‐ console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).

       You don’t want to run terminal commands, which require  terminal  input
       oroutput something because they will mess up vifm’s TUI. Anyway, if you
       did runsuch a command, you can use Ctrl‐L key to update vifm’s TUI.

       Copy and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That’s  why
       vifm  supports  backgrounding  of  this  two operations.  To run :copy,
       :move or :delete command in the background just add " &" at the end  of
       a command.

       For  each background operation a new thread will be created.  Currently
       job cannot be stopped or paused.

       You can see if command is still  running  in  the  :jobs  menu.   Back‐
       grounded  commands  have  progress  instead  of  process id at the line
       beginning.

       Background operations cannot be undone.

              or /proc/mounts) that work too slow for you.  This option can be
              used to stop vifm from making some requests to particular  kinds
              of  file  systems  that  can slow down file browsing.  Currently
              this means don’t check if directory has changed and do not check
              if target of symbolic links exists.

       ssmmaarrttccaassee ssccss

       vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning  and  end  of  com‐
       mands.   That’s  why  you  may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in
       mappings.  For example:

        cmap <f1> man<space>

       will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the  command  line
       mode.

SSttaarrttuupp
       On startup vifm determines several variables that are used  during  the
       session.  They are determined in the order they appear below.

       On  *nix  systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.  On Windows
       systems vifm tries to find correct  home  directory  in  the  following
       order:
        ‐ $HOME variable;
        ‐ $USERPROFILE variable;
        ‐ a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

       vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the fol‐
       lowing places:
        ‐ $VIFM variable;
        ‐ parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
        ‐ $HOME/.vifm directory;
        ‐ $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

       vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following
       places:
        ‐ $MYVIFMRC variable;
        ‐ vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
        ‐ $VIFM/vifmrc file.

       See Startup section above for the explanations on $VIFM and  $MYVIFMRC.

       The  vifmrc  file  contains  commands  that  will  be  executed on vifm
       startup.  See $MYVIFMRC variable description for search algorithm  used
       to  find  vifmrc.  Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To
       use multi line commands precede each next line with a slash (whitespace
       before  slash  is  ignored,  but all spaces at the end of the lines are
       saved).  For example: set
           \smartcase equals "setsmartcase".  When set<space here>
            smartcase equals "set  smartcase".

       The $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it  by
       hand  to change the settings, but it’s not recommended to do that, edit
       vifmrc instead.  You  can  control  what  settings  will  be  saved  in
       vifminfo by setting ´vifminfo’ option.  Vifm always writes this file on
       exit unless ’vifminfo’ option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory
       history,  filetypes,  fileviewers  and registers in the file are merged
       with vifm configuration (which has bigger priority).

       The $VIFM/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.   vifm  modifies
       it’s  PATH  environment  variable to let user run those scripts without
       specifying full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will  be
       added  to  PATH too.  Script in a subdirectory overlaps script with the
       same name in all its parent directories.

       The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.

       vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is
       implemented  using  file  associations  mechanism.  To enable automated
       mounts, one needs to use a specially formated program line in  filetype
       or filextype commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

       1)  FUSE_MOUNT  This format should be used in case when all information
       needed for mounting all files of a particular type is the  same.   E.g.
       mounting of tar files don’t require any file specific options.

       Format line:
         FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

       Example filetype command: >
         :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse‐zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

       2)  FUSE_MOUNT2  This format allows to use specially formatted files to
       perform mounting and is useful for mounting remotes, for example remote
       file systems over ftp or ssh.

       Format line:
         FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

       Example filetype command:
         :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR

       Example file content:
           root@127.0.0.1:/

       All  %  macros  are  expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following
       meaning:
         ‐ %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file
         ‐ %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which
       is created by vifm basing on the value of fusehome option.
         ‐  %PARAM  value  is filled from the first line of file (whole line),
       though in the future it can be changed to whole file content
         ‐ %CLEAR means that you want to clear  screen  before  running  mount
       command.

       %CLEAR is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount
       commands likely wont work without them.

       Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

       Commands:

         :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
         :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
         :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a  file  or  files  to
       open.
         :DiffVifm    select  a  file  or files to compare to the current file
       with
                     :vert diffsplit.
         :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

       Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right
       pane directory.

       The  plugin  have  only  two  settings.   It’s  a string variable named
       g:vifm_term to let user  specify  command  to  run  gui  terminal.   By
       default  it’s  equal  to ´xterm ‐e’.  And another string variable named
       g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"  by  default  and  specifies  path  to
       vifm’s  executable.   To  pass  arguments to vifm use g:vifm_exec_args,
       which is empty by default.

       To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file  to  either  the  system  wide
       vim/plugin directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

       If  you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide
       plugin directory add

       let loaded_vifm=1

       to your ~/.vimrc file.
